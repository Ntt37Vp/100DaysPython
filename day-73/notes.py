# Day 73 Goals: what you will make by the end of the day

# Import
    # import pandas as pd

# Data Exploration
    # df = pd.read_csv("data/colors.csv")
    # colors_df.head()
    # colors_df['name'].nunique()
    # colors_df.groupby('is_trans').count()
    # colors_df.is_trans.value_counts()

    # Challenge: Read the sets.csv data and take a look at the first and last couple of rows.
        # sets_df = pd.read_csv('data/sets.csv')
        # sets_df.head()
        # sets_df.tail()

    # Challenge: In which year were the first LEGO sets released and what were these sets called?
        # sets_df.sort_values('year').head()
